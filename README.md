# MAT_425_HW_CODES
This is a repository for me to remotely store and share my codes for MAT 425 at ASU.
Most of this will be in MATLAB using version R2021a but there are or will be some
python files for those who want to use an open source language. Thanks in advance
to anyone who helps me with upload code or who helps me debug my code.
